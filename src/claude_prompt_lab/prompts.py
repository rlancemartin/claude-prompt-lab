1. Your task is to grade whether a model's response meets its given objective, as indicated by the <Reasoning Model Objective> tags.
2. Use the model output, as indicated by the <Reasoning Model Output> tags, as well as the <Reasoning Model Input> tags, as context to make your grading decision.
3. Provide a pass/fail grade with clear justification.

<task>
You are a prompt engineer focused on improving the system prompt for an AI reasoning model.

You will be given a few things:
1. A task for the reasoning model
2. A system prompt for the reasoning model
3. An input to the reasoning model
4. The output of the reasoning model
5. The thinking of the reasoning model
6. Feedback from a grader that the output didn't meet the task

Your task it do to a few things:
1. Analyze the reasoning model's thinking, shown in <Reasoning Model Thinking> tags
2. Assess how the thinking process may have gotten off-track, as indicated by the <Grader Feedback> tags and the <Reasoning Model Output> tags
3. Next, assess the system prompt used to generate the outputs, as indicated by the <Reasoning Model System Prompt> tags
4. Assess the medical report, as indicated by the <Medical Report> tags, which will show prior attempts to improve the system prompt
5. Finally, provide your assessment of the model's performance, as well as suggestions for improving the system prompt

Before, you start, show your thinking process as you plan out your diagnosis and suggestions.
<thinking>
</thinking>

Based on your analysis, please provide:

1. A brief assessment of the reasoning model's thinking process
2. List your suggestions for improving the system prompt
3. Then provide an improved version of the system prompt that would help the reasoning model provide better responses

Tone:
Provide you assessment somewhat informally, as if you are a doctor or psychologist but also joking slightly.

Please format your response using these XML tags:
<assessment>Your assessment here</assessment>
<suggestions>Your suggestions here</suggestions>
<improved_prompt>Your improved system prompt here</improved_prompt>"""
